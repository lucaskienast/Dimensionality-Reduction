Matrix decomposition methods, also called matrix factorization methods, are a foundation of linear algebra in computers, even for basic operations such as solving systems of linear equations, calculating the inverse, and calculating the determinant of a matrix. It is an approach that can simplify more complex matrix operations that can be performed on the decomposed matrix rather than on the original matrix itself."
